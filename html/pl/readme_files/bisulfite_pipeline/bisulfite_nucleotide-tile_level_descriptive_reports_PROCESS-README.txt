Bisulfiteseq Nucleotide/Tile Level Descriptive Reports
Author: Nick Bild
Date: 2016-08-18
Version 1.0: Initial development.

Description
--------

Bisulfiteseq Nucleotide/Tile Level Descriptive Reports generates descriptive reports at the nucleotide and tile level, and also clusters data and performs PCA.  BedGraph tracks are generated for use with IGV, and Circos images are generated.

Dependencies
--------

Perl v5 is required.  R version 3.0.1 is required, as well as the "methylKit" library.

Software installed on marburg (192.168.0.14) in /home/act/software/nickbild.

Usage Instructions
--------

* Bisulfiteseq Nucleotide/Tile Level Descriptive Reports is available via the bisulfiteseq pipeline (note that step numbers may change over time):

9. nucleotide/tile level descriptive reports

* Values for the following entries on oap_database.txt will be asked for:

[GENOME_ASSEMBLY]
[METHYLKIT_ANNO]
[UCSC_GENE_DESC]
[KARYOTYPE]

METHYLKIT_ANNO is generated by the UCSC table browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables).  Select an appropriate genome and assembly, then "Genes and Gene Predictions" for group, and select "BED - browser extensible data" for output format.

* Output

Relative to the project directory, the following files will be generated:

methylkit/cytosine-tile-level-report.txt			-- C methylation report, tile level.
methylkit/cytosine-nucleo-level-report.txt			-- C methylation report, nucleotide level.
methylkit/pca_CHH.png						-- PCA of samples, CHH context data.
methylkit/pca_CHG.png						-- PCA of samples, CHG context data.
methylkit/pca_CpG.png						-- PCA of samples, CpG context data.
methylkit/cluster_CHH.png					-- Clustering of samples, CHH context data.
methylkit/cluster_CHG.png					-- Clustering of samples, CHG context data.
methylkit/cluster_CpG.png					-- Clustering of samples, CpG context data.
methylkit/correlation_CHH.txt					-- Pearson's pairwise correlation between samples, CHH context.
methylkit/correlation_CHG.txt					-- Pearson's pairwise correlation between samples, CHG context.
methylkit/correlation_CpG.txt					-- Pearson's pairwise correlation between samples, CpG context.
methylkit/cytosine-tile-level-report.txt.<SAMPLE-NAME>.<CONTEXT>.bedGraph		-- bedGraph tracks for IGV.  Methylated C counts.
methylkit/cytosine-tile-level-report.txt.<SAMPLE-NAME>.<CONTEXT>.bedGraph.circos.png	-- Circos visualization.  Methylated C counts.
